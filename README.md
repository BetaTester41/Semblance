# Semblance
![build](https://github.com/EcoBuilder13/Semblance/workflows/Actions/badge.svg)

Semblance is a server side Minecraft mod for the Fabric and Quilt mod loaders. It allows you to configure the server brand so you can hide what type of server you are running from the debug screen.

## Configuration
Right now the mod does not have a proper configuration system implemented. So it will use the default value of `TaterMC`. For people who are knowledgeable enough you can change the value of a String in [Config.java](https://github.com/EcoBuilder13/Semblance/blob/master/src/main/java/ga/mchorizons/semblance/Config.java) and build the mod for yourself with a custom brand.

## FAQ

- Can you port to Forge?

    - No, read the [notice](https://modrinth.com/mod/dashloader).
- Can you port to another verison?

    - I will only port to newer versions of the game. All releases have their version limited to all minor releases of the current major version when released.
